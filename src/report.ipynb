    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to use ensemble methods to discriminate between different sleep stages from EEG sleep data. We experiment with different ensemble methods and parameters in order to compare the results and find the most appropriate approach given our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first prepare and filter the data for further use. Then perform Wavelet decomposition to identify and extract different frequencies from the data. Subsequently, we do feature extraction, where features correspond to the power of the frequency bands. Afterwards, we train and test two different ensemble methods; Random Forest and Adaboost. In order to optimize these results we then perform hyperparameter search and compare the results. To finish we propose and implement further methods to optimize classification.\n"

    "Data was collected with the Traumschreiber, high-tech sleep mask developed for research purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used to train and test the classifier consists of five data sets corresponding to different nights of sleep. Each data set containing information from seven Electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and one Electrocardiogram (ECG) channel, recorded for about seven hours of sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is labeled by epochs of one second, where each second contains about 200 microvolt points. These labels correspond to the sleep stages introduced by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) that differentiates between five main sleeping stages: \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Wakefulness: Active wakefulness with beta waves (+13 Hz) and relaxed wakefulness with mostly alpha wave (8-13 Hz).\n",
    "(2) Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) 1: Dominated by Theta activity (4-7 Hz).\n",
    "(3) NREM-2: Characterized by Theta waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes.\n",
    "(4) NREM-3: Dominated by Delta wave (0.5-2 Hz) along with some sleep spindles.\n",
    "(5) Rapid Eye Movement (REM): Characterized by low-amplitude mixed-frequency brain waves. Theta, alpha and even beta activity can be observed.\n"

    "### Discrete Wavelet Transform Overview\n",
    "The wavelet are waves of irregular form in shape and compactly supported. These properties along with the main two operations of scaling and shifting, which produce a time-scale representation of the signal, make wavelets an ideal tool for analysing signals of non-stationary nature. Their irregular shape makes them suitable for analysing signals with discontinuities, and their compactly supported nature enables temporal localisation. Motivated by the adaptive time-frequency resolution properties of the Wavelet Transform and the corresponding fact that some stages in sleep recordings have a well defined time-frequency domain we opted to use Discrete Wavelet Decomposition to obtain five sub-bands of the original signal and consequently performed feature extraction on them for the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Discrete Wavelet Decomposition algorithm we implemented relays firstly on a dyadic scaling of the wavelength and secondly on a discrete shifting across the original signal. The first operation serves as half band filter which halves the highest frequency component of the original signal,providing  lower computational time and less memory usage. This in accordance to Nyquist’s sampling rate allowing the usage of half of the previous sample points at each level of the decomposition for a proper reconstruction of the original signal. \n",

    "The algorithm adopted can be better visualized as a tree of low and high pass filter, which perform the decomposition of the signal into different frequency bands applying successive filtering of the time domain signal. \n",
    "The original signal is successively decomposed into components of lower resolution, while the high frequency components are not analysed any further.This decomposition halves the time resolution since only half the number of samples now characterizes the entire signal. \n",
    "However it doubles the frequency resolution, since the frequency band of the signal now spans only half the previous.The maximum depth of decomposition is dependent on the input size of the data to be analysed, with 2N data samples enabling the breakdown of the signal into N discrete levels using the discrete wavelet transform. This procedure thus offers a good time resolution at high frequencies, and good frequency resolution at low frequencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "This matches well the resolution of each sub-band with certain sleep stages patterns, for example capturing at an higher time resolution the signal of the beta stage, which shows abrupt discontinuities .\n",
    "We discarded the first two levels of the decomposition simply because those frequency bands are completely absent it the original signal. In conclusion the frequencies that are most prominent in the original signal will appear as high amplitudes in the corresponding region of the Discrete Wavelet Transform signal that includes those particular frequencies.\n",

    "• Wavelet transform allows to adapt and extract relevant information from both time and frequency domain. Because some sleep stages are mainly characterized by the time domain while others by the frequency domain, wavelet decomposition is most appropriate for extracting frequency bands from EEG sleep data.   • Random Forest and Adaboost preform both over xxx • Random Forest outperforms Adaboost algorithm by xxx • Hyperparameter search optimizes the results from both methods significantly. • Smoothing classification results within sleep stages can help to improve overall results"
